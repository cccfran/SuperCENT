\title{Predict using known centrality in two-stage model (oracle)}
\usage{
predict_two_stage_oracle(A, X_test, ret_two_stage, u_test, v_test, scaled = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{Adjacency matrix (not used in this version, included for interface compatibility)}

\item{X_test}{Covariate matrix for the test set}

\item{ret_two_stage}{A fitted object from \code{two_stage()}}

\item{u_test}{Known test centrality vector (left)}

\item{v_test}{Known test centrality vector (right)}

\item{scaled}{Logical; ignored in current version (included for compatibility)}
}
\value{
A list with predicted outcomes \code{y}, and given \code{u}, \code{v}
}
\description{
Computes predictions using provided \code{u_test}, \code{v_test}.
Intended for oracle evaluation or simulation studies where ground truth is available.
}
\note{
This is a redundant oracle version assuming known latent factors
