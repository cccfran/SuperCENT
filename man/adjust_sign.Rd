\title{Adjust signs of centrality vectors and coefficients}
\usage{
adjust_sign(ret)
}
\arguments{
\item{ret}{A network regression output}
}
\value{
The network regression output with consistently adjusted signs
}
\description{
Resolves the sign ambiguity of estimated centrality vectors \code{u} and \code{v}
by making the largest-magnitude entry positive, and adjusting associated 
coefficients in \code{beta} accordingly.
}
\details{
The vectors \code{u}, \code{v} are only identifiable up to sign, but their products
with covariates or coefficients (e.g., \eqn{u \cdot \hat{\beta}_u}) are uniquely identifiable.
This adjustment ensures sign consistency across runs or for interpretation when needed.
}
\examples{
ret <- list(u = c(-2, -1), beta = c(1, -3))
adjust_sign(ret)
}
