\title{Experimental: Revert vector indexing after semi-supervised adjacency shift}
\usage{
unobserved_shift_back(xx, weights)
}
\arguments{
\item{xx}{A numeric vector aligned to the shifted adjacency matrix}

\item{weights}{A logical vector used for the original shift (same as in \code{A_shift_unobserved_last})}
}
\value{
A numeric vector reordered back to match the original node indexing
}
\description{
This function reverts the node indexing of any vector that was aligned with a shifted adjacency matrix
(as produced by \code{A_shift_unobserved_last}). It is used to restore original order of node-level 
quantities (e.g., eigenvectors, centrality scores) after estimation on the reordered matrix.
}
\note{
This function is experimental and intended for semi-supervised learning pipelines where
only a subset of nodes have observed responses.

\examples{
xx <- c(10, 20, 30, 40)
weights <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
