\title{Experimental: Subsample-based confidence intervals for network regression}
\usage{
hulc(A_train, X_train, y_train, B = 5, FUN, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{A_train}{Adjacency matrix for training nodes}

\item{X_train}{Covariate matrix for training nodes}

\item{y_train}{Response vector for training nodes}

\item{B}{Number of subsample blocks (default \code{5})}

\item{FUN}{Estimator function (e.g., \code{supercent}) that returns a list with element \code{beta}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{FUN} (e.g., \code{l}, \code{lrange}, \code{gap}, \code{folds}, \code{max_iter})}
}
\value{
A matrix of lower and upper bounds for each coefficient in \code{beta}, including centrality effects
}
\description{
Implements HULC confidence intervals (Kuchibhotla et al., 2021)
for regression coefficients in network regression models. The procedure resamples
blocks from the training set and refits the model multiple times using a user-defined estimator.
}
\details{
Each subsample block fits a model on a subset of the training data and extracts the estimated coefficients.
The final interval is formed by taking the componentwise minimum and maximum across all subsample fits.
}
\note{
Assumes \code{beta0vec} is available in the environment to align signs via \code{beta_sign()}.

\examples{
# hulc(A_train, X_train, y_train, FUN = supercent, B = 5, l = 0.1)
